# WINE QUALITY PREDICTION

## Description:
This project focuses on predicting the quality of wine based on its chemical characteristics, providing a real-world application of machine learning in the context of viticulture. The dataset used encompasses diverse chemical attributes, including density and acidity, which serve as the features for three distinct classifier models.

## Key Concepts and Challenges:
### Classifier Models:
The project utilizes three different classifier models for wine quality prediction:

1- Random Forest
2- Stochastic Gradient Descent
3- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
Each model is implemented and evaluated to determine its effectiveness in predicting wine quality.

### Chemical Qualities:
Various chemical attributes are analyzed as predictors for wine quality. Key features include:

* Density
* Acidity
  
These features are crucial in understanding the composition of wine and how they contribute to its overall quality.

### Data Analysis Libraries:
The project makes use of popular Python libraries for data manipulation and analysis:

* Pandas: Used for data manipulation and preprocessing.
* NumPy: Employed for array operations and numerical computations.

### Data Visualization:
To gain insights and visualize patterns in the dataset, the following libraries are utilized:

**Seaborn:** Used for statistical data visualization.

**Matplotlib:** Employed for creating plots and charts to visualize data distributions and relationships.
