# Predicting House Prices with Linear Regression

## Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model using linear regression to estimate house prices based on a dataset with relevant features. Linear regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm, and this project provides hands-on experience in developing, evaluating, and interpreting a predictive model.

## Key Concepts and Challenges:
### Data Collection:
The first step involved obtaining a dataset with numerical features and a target variable for prediction. The dataset serves as the foundation for training and evaluating the linear regression model.

### Data Exploration and Cleaning:
The dataset was thoroughly explored to understand its structure. Steps were taken to handle missing values and ensure data quality. Exploratory data analysis techniques were applied to gain insights into the distribution and characteristics of the features.

### Feature Selection
Identification of relevant features played a crucial role in building an effective predictive model. Through analysis, we selected features that were deemed to contribute significantly to the model's accuracy.

### Model Training
Linear regression was implemented using the Scikit-Learn machine learning library. The training process involved fitting the model to the training dataset, allowing it to learn the relationships between the selected features and the target variable.

### Model Evaluation
The model's performance was assessed using a separate test dataset. Evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error and R-squared were utilized to measure the accuracy and effectiveness of the model in predicting house prices.

### Visualization
Visualizations were created to illustrate the relationship between the predicted and actual house prices. These visual aids enhance the interpretability of the model's predictions and provide insights into its performance.

## Learning Objectives
Understanding of Linear Regression Concepts: Gain insights into the fundamentals of linear regression and how it is applied in predictive modeling.
